# Random Status Lines
Everyone has experienced that panic when your project stops working right as you're trying to demonsrate it.

Random Status Lines is a great way to make it appear like you're doing something cool and hacky, while in reality, you aren't. When your real code stops working, run the status.py file and distract your audience while you fix bugs in the background.

If you want to edit the status text, simply add or remove words and phrases from the lists.

# Dependancies
To use this repository, you can use git clone, but the only important file is status.py, so you can just download and run that one. 
Though do please note, [alive_progress]([url](https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress)) and [random]([url](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)) are required.
They can be downloaded by the following commands:

  -pip install alive_progress

  -pip install random
