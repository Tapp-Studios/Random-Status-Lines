# Random-Status-Lines
Everyone has expirienced that panic when you project stops working right as you're trying to demonstate it.

Random Status Lines is a file that will make it appear like you're doing something cool and hacky, while in reality you aren't. When your real code stops working, run the status.py file and distract your audience while you fix bugs in the background.

If you want to edit the status text, simply add or remove words and prases from the lists.
