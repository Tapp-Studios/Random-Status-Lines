# Random Status Lines
This is a silly project that is surprisingly effective in making the average person thing yoou're doing something really cool in the terminal.
It generates random terminal status lines, complete with errors, loading bars, and ping responses.
If you want to edit the status text, simply add or remove words and phrases from the lists.

# Dependancies
To use this repository, you can use git clone, but the only important file is status.py, so you can just download and run that one. 
Though do please note, [alive_progress]([url](https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress)) and [random]([url](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)) are required.
They can be downloaded by the following commands:

  -pip install alive_progress

  -pip install random
